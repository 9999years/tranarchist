    <h1>relationship anarchy smorgasbord</h1>
    <p>
        to form your relationships you and another can pick any number of
        &ldquo;items&rdquo; from any number of platters. take a huge helping or
        just a small scoop. the dish the two (or more) of you hold is your
        relationship. remember you must agree together on what goes in it! No
        sneaking items in without the other knowing or there will likely be
        conflict or disappointment later. also, it's <em>your</em> dish so if
        you decide to change what you want from the smorgasbord later, that's
        cool.
